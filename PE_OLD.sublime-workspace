			"contents": "# PE_OLD\n\n(Temporarily while I can think of a better name).\n\nIdeas:\n\n- Worlds are limited to the circular buffer, which will be made fixed.\n- All the world is calculated on world creatinon, that 32x32 chunks area, somehow.\n\nSo:\n\n1.- Make it so the buffer is not circular and no chunks x, z < 0 or x, z > 31 are generated.\n2.- Make it so you can't exit the world from the side.\n\nThen:\n\nExpand!\n\n1.- The nether should have nether walls and be 256x256\n2.- Position in the nether is overworld x 2\n\nThan:\n\nGo crazy!\n\n1.- Make chunks in the overworld 256 blocks tall. Generate the sky dimension on top of the normal dimension.\n2.- Indev level themes.\n3.- Profit!\n\n## Meh\n\nI did a very nice vanilla Indev in beta, it's so nice but:\n\n1.- Add passing of days to get seasons working.\n2.- SMP of course\n\n# 2nd iteration\n\nMost of the stuff never got done, but I have limited worlds with Indev themes. Now I want to take every theme and make a slightly different experience. The 1st I'm visiting is the Hell theme which would need a ways to make trees renewable. Remember that trees spawn without canopy.\n\nTHe way is using acorn seeds, which you can plan in the groudn to get oak saplings. Acorn seeds are sometimes dropped by skeletons.  \n\n# Wha\n\nAdded 0 notes during months. It's quite evolved and works great. Uses lightmaps and starlight and actually runs at a very good frame rate on very old or very limited hardware, which was the goal.\n\nNow spice it up a bit:\n\n* Define a proper gameplay for each level theme.\n* Add the poison island level theme.\n\n# Different gameplays for different level themes\n\n* [X] Rename world generators to \"Infdev Island\", \"Alpha Island\" and \"Floating Island\".\n* [X] Base achievements for hell, forest & paradise\n* [X] Eat animation from infhell\n* [X] Open creative inventory directly fix like infhell\n\n## Hell\n\n* [X] Very tough survival, also wood is a very valuable resource as most trees come up without canopy so you can't get saplings that way. Skeletons drop acorns which you should plant in tilled land to grow saplings. --> \n\t* [X] Needs testing - in hell it needs to be fertilized with bonemeal otherwise tilled land will decay and acorn will drop, which is nice.\n\n* [X] Thing something that has to do with fossils! Well, they are a huge source of bone meal, there should be a way to produce GRASS using them (A very small chance?) \n\t* [?] Fine tune... Why shrooms pop out as drops sometimes?\n\n* [X] Big mushrooms should have a purpose. ¿Smelt into coal? Maybe a smaller coal item that produces just 2 torches and burns for 1/2 the time.\n\t* [X] Item charcoal\n\t* [X] Smelting recipes (to obtain, as fuel)\n\t* [X] Crafting recipes: combine with stick for 2 torches\n\n* [ ] Iron boat. What happens if you put a wooden boat in the lava?\n\n* Achievements\n\t* [X] Grass from dirt - Fertilize dead soil and bring it back to life\n\t* [X] Plant an acorn - Plant an acorn on tilled field\n\t* [X] Fertililze an accorn\n\t* [X] Cook big shrooms - To get some cheap charcoal\n\n## Forest\n\n* Asegurarse de generar un laberinto.\n\n* Idear una progresión tipo twilight, con cosas que hacer para hacer otras cosas.\n\n## Paradise\n\n* Paradise level should trigger \"sky\" generator by default (you can change it ofc)\n\n* This was supposed the \"peaceful\" or \"easy\" variant, but I think something should be done to this. I know (or I believe) he original Aether was somewhat inspired in this. It would be nice to do some research and know where the aether came from and what were the initial builds and what kind of stuff they had and do something similar.\n\n* Add big flowers and some Aether stuff: bronze dungeons and some mobs would be a nice start.\n\n* [X] The sky generator generated a FLOOR??? at y = 0\n* [X] Ported Aether stuff\n* [X] Ultra bothered by the fact that apparently a bunch of mobs are being spawned in the sun light?!!?\n\n## Forest\n\n* [X] I've added good ol' mazes but I'm adding the \"good\" maze for non sky forests. The minotaur maze.\n* [X] Everything (maze) is ported - have to sort out the blocks used. \n* [X] Backport minotaurs and minoshrooms. They use new AI... 1. Try them as is as most of the new AI foundation is there - and 2. If taht fails, it should be easy to back port them to the old system.\n\n--\n\n* [X] Port kobolds and/or redcaps. Think on where/purpose. Both could be natural spawns if !blockcanseethesky stuff. Or whatever. Dunno if there's backend for cave monsters ?\n* [ ] Add more spawners to mazes?\n* [ ] Achievement\n\t[ ] Hunt Minotaur\n\t[X] Hunt Minoshroom.\n\t[X] Whatever with kobolds/redcaps.\n* [X] Add special axe that axes a lot, which is what the minoshroom drops.\n\n--\n\n* [X] Added a means to re-generate the world if conditions are not met.\n\t* [X] Forest maze conditions:\n\t\t* [X] Small sized or floating island based: at least 1 random hill maze\n\t\t+ [X] Normal sized: 1 minotaur maze spawning in the central chunk. \n\t\t* [X] Big/Huge sized: 1 minutaur maze per 16x16 chunk subregion.\n\n\t\t* Minotaur mazes have a 14 block high entrance. Condition is that they must generate at 64+14 = 78 or below, in the open.\n\t\t\n* [ ] Message \"retrying world generation\".\n* [X] Modify feature provider so it doesn't try outside of the map!\n* [X] Very important modification! upon processing the entity list, only update those within a square radius of 8 chunks in every direction, which saves TONS of time in BIG and HUGE levels! \n\n* [ ] Themed dungeons ? was that a thing? (i.e. select spawner characteristics)\n\n## Added optifine\n\nYay! fps boosted on shitty systems!\n\n## New stuff\n\n* [X] Use b173 Twilight Forest entities for animales in the forest theme.\n* [X] Undo (if done) the level theme based temperature/humidity and extract it from the biome.\n* [X] Make it so if the level theme based fixed biome is null, it uses the normal ramp for a new theme \"biomes\".\n* [X] Attempt to make a more flexible day cycle management (i.e. fixed celestial angle based upon level theme, not world provider) \n\t(RN how does it do the fixed hour in paradise / hell? Can't understand HOW!!) \n\n\tIn hell you can get night, not in paradise. The only difference is on level theme settings: dayCycle = false. But that flag only seems to be used to run the bad moon logic or not.\n\n\tOH. It seems to be tied to the world provider. FUCK. It is fixed to 0 for the world provider sky. I would get day cycle in another world provider for paradise. Time to make properl logic for this.\n\n\t`fixedCelestialAngle`.\n\n\t* For hell: Day cycle.\n\t* For forest: Check vanilla twilite\n\t* For paradise: `1.0F` (still doesn't seem to affect????  HOW TF DO I DO THIS LOL)\n\n\tCelestial angle is advancing normally, or so it seems. So it has to be lightmap related? Nah I was being stupid. Paradise is summer so time set night which sets 13000 still gets daylight.\n\n\tOK\n\n\tForget the ton of paragraphs. Implemeting this rn.\n\n* [ ] Think about gameplay items for a desert and a glacier based theme (for the future).\n\t* [ ] both lack trees, dirt and saplings must be obtained. Make sure skeletons still drop acorns.\n\t* [ ] cold mechanics. Need to reactivate code for freeze\n\n* [ ] Add \"Override level test\" to level creation extra options to override \"level is valid\" check\n* [X] Add a biome map. Simple, don't over do it. Use PostAlpha's. Which is almost vanilla's. Recreate new biomegen classes. BiomeGenBetaForest... etc\n* [X] Remove optifog log and other stupid shit.\n* [X] Add \"preferredWorldgen\" to levelthemes and de-hardcode it\n* [X] Add torches to some trees, somehow\n* [X] Biomes level theme uses PostAlpha ramps;\n* [ ] optional fancy grass?\n* [X] Make sure the needed initialization is due so multibiomes work in SMP",
