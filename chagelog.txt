## Features: Theme Hell - Tough survival

Very few trees have an actual canopy, so you must find a way to make wood renewable. Also, seeds only drop from tall grass and there's no grass. Luckily, there's plenty of fossils.

* Plant acorn on tilled field, fertilize to get new sapling.
* You can fertilize dead dirt to get new grass (small chance) or mushrooms.
* Big mushroom blocks can be smelted into charcoal. Charcoal and sticks gives you two torches.
* Craft an iron boat with 6 iron ingots.
* Added achievements for all the above.
* Eating animation. 
* Small fixes.

## Big problem

Laggy server, need to do some proper review or port r125 netcode like in infhell. Will leave for later (next?)
