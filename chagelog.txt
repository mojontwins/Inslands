# v240602

## Features: Theme Hell - Tough survival

Very few trees have an actual canopy, so you must find a way to make wood re-
newable. Also, seeds only drop from tall grass and there's no grass. Luckily, 
there's plenty of fossils.

* Plant acorn on tilled field, fertilize to get new sapling.
* You can fertilize dead dirt to get new grass (small chance) or mushrooms.
* Big mushroom blocks can be smelted into charcoal. Charcoal and sticks gives
  you two torches.
* Craft an iron boat with 6 iron ingots.
* Added achievements for all the above.
* Eating animation. 
* Small fixes.

## Big problem

Wobbly server, need to do some proper review or port r125 netcode like in 
Infhell. Will leave for later (next?).

# v240607

## Features: Theme Paradise - Simplified Aether clone

* Selecting theme paradise pre-selects the sky generator if no world type was selected.
* Sky generator works again. Noise gen has been slightly modified so land chunks are thicker so they can contain more dungeons.
* Falling into the void works again.
* Aerclouds for paradise floating islands (from Aether).
* Aether Bronze dungeons adapted to the fact that levels are small and they have to spawn more often, to allow for hollower sections. 
* Find crying obsidian, obsidian wands and saddles in Bronze Dungeons.
* Substituted most vanilla animals for Aether variants. Fly to other islands using saddled pigs or cows.
* Small fixes

## Big? problem

Still using b1.7.3 netcode, a situation which won't change for a while.

# v240625

* Optifine! That means you can tweak for speed, get free mipmaps, and a much faster chunk renderer and tessellator.
* Paradise theme is always at noon, mid-summer.
* Forest theme is now a permanent twilight. Seasons do hapen, tho.
* Configurable sunset/sunrise colours per theme basis. Activated for the Forest theme.
* Underhill, hedge and minotaur mazes for the Forest theme.
* Twilight animals and baddies for the Forest theme.
* Preliminary multi-biome level theme, using ramps and special beta-based biomes complete with colorizers. Everything is cached so no impact.
