(Temporarily while I can think of a better name).

Ideas:

- Worlds are limited to the circular buffer, which will be made fixed.
- All the world is calculated on world creatinon, that 32x32 chunks area, somehow.

So:

1.- Make it so the buffer is not circular and no chunks x, z < 0 or x, z > 31 are generated.
2.- Make it so you can't exit the world from the side.

Then:

Expand!

1.- The nether should have nether walls and be 256x256
2.- Position in the nether is overworld x 2

Than:

Go crazy!

1.- Make chunks in the overworld 256 blocks tall. Generate the sky dimension on top of the normal dimension.
2.- Indev level themes.
3.- Profit!

# Meh

I did a very nice vanilla Indev in beta, it's so nice but:

1.- Add passing of days to get seasons working.
2.- SMP of course
